Throughout this roadmap, you'll progressively build the skills needed to become a well-rounded Flutter developer. You’ll learn how to craft intuitive UIs, handle user input, and implement smooth navigation. You’ll also work with networking and APIs, manage both local and remote data, and apply robust state-management techniques. The roadmap guides you through integrating essential plugins such as Maps, Camera, and Payments, along with writing tests to ensure app quality. Finally, you’ll explore open-source contribution by creating your own packages and gain exposure to CI/CD practices to streamline development workflows.
