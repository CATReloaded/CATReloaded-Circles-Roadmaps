# Week 1: Advanced State Management with BLoC

## 🎯 Objective

By the end of this week, you will:

- Understand **why large apps need structured architecture**, predictable data flow, and separation of concerns.
- Learn the core principles behind the **BLoC (Business Logic Component) pattern**, including streams, events, and states.
- Apply **Cubit** and **BLoC** to real scenarios such as theming, connectivity monitoring, API fetching, and infinite scrolling.
- Learn how to use **Freezed** for immutable state classes and code generation.
- Build a foundation that prepares you for **clean architecture**, **layered design**, and large-scale applications.
