# Week 5: MVVM & Clean Architecture

## 🎯 Objective

By the end of this week, you will:

- Understand **MVVM architecture** in Flutter and how to separate concerns:

  - **View** – UI layer
  - **ViewModel** – Business logic and state management
  - **Model** – Data layer
  - Implement **Repository pattern** and **Dependency Injection (DI)** for scalable apps
  - Connect MVVM with **API projects** for real-world applications

- Learn **Clean Architecture** principles in Flutter:
  - Structure projects into **Domain, Data, and Presentation layers**
  - Implement **Entities, Repositories, and Use Cases**
  - Connect **Blocs or State Management** with the presentation layer
  - Apply **Dependency Injection** and maintain separation of concerns
  - Build **UI pages** for posts, add/update, and detail views
