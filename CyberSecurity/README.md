# CAT Reloaded Cyber_Security Road Map

<blockquote>
  <h3 align="center"><em>So, you choose the hard way :)</em></h3>
</blockquote>

## Before we start, let's answer a few FAQs:

### 1. What is cyber security?

Think of cyber security as the digital version of having a really good lock on your front door, plus a guard dog, a security camera, and maybe a moat with alligators—just to be safe. It's all about keeping the bad guys (a.k.a. hackers) from sneaking into your online world to mess with your stuff, steal your secrets, or just cause chaos. These sneaky attacks can aim to swipe your sensitive info, blackmail you, or bring your systems to a grinding halt. So, cyber security is basically your all-in-one toolkit to keep the digital boogeymen out and your data safe and sound.


### 2. Why do I learn cybersecurity?

So, why should you dive into cybersecurity? Well, in today’s world, everything's going digital—your shopping, your banking, even your grandma's cat videos. But with great ~~connectivity~~ comes great responsibility... and a bunch of cyber threats. Here’s why getting into cybersecurity is a smart move:

- **Protect your stuff**: Keep your personal info and company data safe from those pesky cyber thieves who want to steal your secrets.
- **Be a digital hero**: Help protect the online world and make it safer for everyone—think of it as your superhero origin story.
- **Score some sweet career points**: Cybersecurity pros are in high demand, so you'll be entering a field with tons of job opportunities and room to grow.
- **You can also be the "good hacker"**: Cybersecurity isn't just about defending—you can go on the offensive too, if that's your thing.

And, let’s be real—cybersecurity pays well too. So, not only do you get to be the digital defender, but you also get to bring home some serious cash. XD

**Jokes aside:**

افتكر دايما وانت بتتعلم علم زي ده انك بتتعلمه عشان تنفع الامة والمسلمين  وان دورك لا يقل اهمية عن دور اي شغلانة هدفها حماية المسلم واملاكه, وان انت بتعمل العمل ده لوجه خالص لله بهدف تعزيز قوتها كأمة ف العالم الحديث


### 3. What will I be able to do and what's not?

- Sniff out and smack down common cyber threats like a pro.
- Set up digital fortresses to protect systems and data from the bad guys.
- Play detective by finding and fixing vulnerabilities before hackers do.
- Build and keep an eye on secure networks, making sure everything runs smoothly.
- Create kick-ass plans for what to do when (not if) something goes wrong.

But let’s clear up a few things—cybersecurity isn’t about:
- Magically making everything 100% secure, because, **spoiler alert**, new threats are always popping up.
- Turning into a hacker to break into your crash's Facebook account or steal your neighbor's Wi-Fi password (seriously, that's illegal).
- Becoming an all-knowing cybersecurity guru overnight—this stuff takes time, practice, and constant learning to master.

So, while you’ll be pretty awesome at protecting the digital world, you’re not going to turn into a super-hacker vigilante. Sorry, no _**Matrix**_ moments here :(


### 4. What are the most famous fields of cybersecurity?

- Network Security
- Penetration Testing
- Digital Forensics
- Incident Response
- Malware Analysis
- and much more, when you can learn about all of them from these amazing videos ->  [So you wanna do security?](https://youtu.be/i8rizLc4hc0) | [يوم في حياة X](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ompZWkWsn9A&list=PLv7cogHXoVhXIg4R6-eyws4isM2-sh2St) |
