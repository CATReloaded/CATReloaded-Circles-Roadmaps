## **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**

#### **Topics Covered:**

_Introduction to OOP, Classes and Objects, Encapsulation, Abstraction, Inheritance, Polymorphism, Multiple Inheritance, Interface, Abstract Classes vs Interfaces, Composition vs Inheritance_

> - You can't study OOP with C++ alone because some important concepts, like **interfaces**, aren't fully covered. You need to either learn another language that includes these concepts or study C++ alongside a language that covers them. Other OOP topics not fully represented in C++ include **abstract classes**, **polymorphism (in a more advanced way)**, and **multiple inheritance**.
> - To cover all OOP concepts, I recommend learning **Java** or **C#**, as both languages provide full support for **interfaces**, **abstract classes**, **polymorphism**, and **multiple inheritance** (in C#). **Python** is also a good option.

## **System Analysis and Design**

### **Overview**

> **Note:** It’s recommended to study **SAAD (Systems Analysis and Design)** before **SWE (Software Engineering)** because SAAD provides essential foundational concepts like system modeling, requirements gathering, and process design, which are crucial for understanding and developing software systems effectively before diving into the engineering and implementation-focused aspects of SWE.

---

### **What the Course Includes ?**

This course focuses on understanding user requirements, analyzing system needs, and designing solutions. Key topics include project management, use case analysis, process modeling, system design, and information system implementation, with hands-on experience in developing user-centered systems.

---

### **Resources**

- **Video Playlists:**

  - [Systems Analysis & Design by Dr. Alshaimaa A. Tantawy](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLMzaNeHCFdm-0QIV9CuFZpIi_4-nKH4Xi)
  - there is no slides .. check the textbook or take notes/screenshots with the vedios !

---

### **Textbook:**

The course uses _Systems Analysis and Design_ by Wixom & Roth (5th Edition, 2012), which covers the entire systems development life cycle, including methods for analyzing, designing, and building information systems. Topics include requirements gathering, use case analysis, process modeling, and system implementation.

## **Software Engineering**

> _Notes_:
>
> 1. You only need to focus on the first 8 chapters of the Software Engineering book for now. These chapters will cover the foundational concepts you'll need before diving deeper into your track. The remaining chapters can be explored later when you're ready for more advanced topics.
> 2. The primary & only study material is the slides provided in the resources (first 8 Chapters). Your focus should be on understanding these slides thoroughly. If needed, refer to additional sources for clarification, but make sure to grasp the key concepts from the slides first.
> 3. There's no single source that covers all the content you'll need for the course. You'll have to refer to various resources until you've reviewed everything that's required. This approach will help you gain a deeper understanding of the material and fill in any gaps.

### **What the Course Includes ?**

Software Engineering focuses on the systematic design, development, testing, and maintenance of software systems to ensure they meet user requirements and are reliable, scalable, and maintainable. It teaches principles like modular design, agile methodologies, and quality assurance, essential for building robust systems. Studying SWE is crucial for learning how to manage complex projects, work effectively in teams, and deliver high-quality software solutions. in development, it provides the foundation for creating scalable architectures, writing efficient code, and collaborating with other stakeholders, making it integral to succeeding in the tech industry.
