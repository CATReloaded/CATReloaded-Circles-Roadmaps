A roadmap for iOS developers that can guide you from the very basics of the track and help you improve your skills.

**First of all, we have to talk about**

# 📗 Why should you learn iOS development?
![ios](https://www.scnsoft.com/mobile/ios-development.svg)

with over 1.8 billion apple devices all over the world including (📱 iPhone, 📱 iPad, 💻 MacOS 🖥 Apple TV, ⌚ Apple Watch) it has become essential for companies to develop iOS apps for their services.

Before starting with Android you have to know about Git and GitHub. (If you know about them you can skip this section).

# Git and GitHub:

First,what is the difference between Git and GitHub? [See this](https://devmountain.com/blog/git-vs-github-whats-the-difference/)

You can learn about them from these resources:

1. [This playlist](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGOj5yH7evk). (Recommended)

2. [This course.](https://www.coursera.org/learn/introduction-to-version-control?specialization=meta-front-end-developer) 

Use this file that NOW,you need to know how to use Git and GitHub with Xcode which provides app builders with an integrated development environment (IDE) optimized for iOS apps. [Watch this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHEuUHqLvRk)

You are ready to start your journey with iOS but before starting with iOS you have to learn a programming language and because it's iOS, we recommend you start learning with Swift.
___
# But.. Why Swift? 🤔
* High performance and excellent responsiveness of mobile apps;
* Access to native API’s and the ability to integrate the full range of features, that will exchange the data with other iOS devices;
* Out-of-the-box solutions for CI/CD;
* Enterprise application development;
* Ability to create eye-carving and easily navigable UI;
* Unique tech stack enhancing the security of an app;
* Swift is a statically typed language enabling developers to rely on XCode and be able to track the errors and speed up the debugging process;
* Clear code, rich UX, smooth performance – that’s what you’ll get if you choose to build a Swift app.
